## üîß Project Overview

This project is an **Arduino-based borewell pump controller** that automates water pumping with safety features, timers, and AC phase monitoring. It is designed to:

- Control a submersible pump via **2-channel relays**.
- Monitor **AC power sources** (GF and FF) using **PC817 optocouplers**.
- Prevent motor damage using **motor safety checks**.
- Alert the user if **both AC sources are present simultaneously**.
- Provide **custom timer controls** (15, 30, 60 minutes).
- Include **emergency stop** functionality.

## üîå AC Detection Circuit

Each AC source is connected as follows:

```text
AC Line (L) ‚Üí 150K 1W Resistor ‚Üí DB107S Bridge Rectifier ‚Üí PC817 LED ‚Üí AC Neutral (N)
The PC817 output pin is read by Arduino to detect AC presence (active LOW).

Ensures safe isolation between high voltage AC and Arduino logic.

‚ö° Features & Behavior
Timer Control

Start pump for 15, 30, or 60 minutes using buttons.

Timer LEDs indicate the selected duration.

Timer can be restarted any time using the buttons.

Emergency Stop

Press 15-minute button for 7 seconds to trigger emergency stop.

Turns off all relays, stops pump, and pulses red LED.

Resets only after both AC sources are turned off.

Pump Motor Safety

Motor optocoupler checks if the pump is running after relays are activated.

If no motor detected in 5 seconds, relays turn OFF and wait 20 seconds before retry.

AC Power Alerts

If both GF and FF AC sources are present, system triggers alert buzzer and red LED.

Prevents pump operation in unsafe conditions.

White LED Pulse

Pulses while the pump is running to indicate operation visually.

Buzzer / Melody

Beeps on pump start, timer expiry, and emergency events.

Different melodies for GF, FF, and default alerts.

Serial Monitor Output

Provides real-time status of pump, timer, relays, AC detection, motor state, and emergency.
